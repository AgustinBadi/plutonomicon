# Welcome to the Plutonomicon


The Plutonomicon is a developer-driven guide to the Plutus smart contract language _in practice_.

Since this ecosystem is moving at a breakneck speed, we ask that ANY information posted that is not confirmed to work on chain be labelled as `ðŸ”§ work in progress`.


For a brief introduction to the plutus language, see [The Fundamentals of Plutus](fundamentals.md).

For an overview of the Plutus number typeclass stack (and additional numeric tools in `plutus-extra`) see [Plutus Numeric Hierarchy](numeric.md).
